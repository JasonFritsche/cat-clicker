<h1>My First Repo</h1>

<p> This project served two purposes for me. I am new to programming and new to GitHub. I wanted to get my feet wet with JavaScript and so I decided to make a simple website. I also wanted to go ahead and start tinkering with GitHub, so I decided this would be my first repo. </p>

<h2>Edit Away</h2>

<p>This project only consists of an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. Please feel free to edit this is any way.
  
  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  
  <p>I am a total noob and would appreciate any feedback on any part of this repo. Please critique me on my formatting, any ways to tidy up my code, what I should and should not include in my readme, or anything else. I've got thick skin. </p>
